# Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge 🧱⚡️

This repository is a day-by-day record of my progress during the **Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge** (organized by Codebasics and Indian Data Club).

As part of my **#AIReset** 12-week plan, I am using this challenge to bridge the gap between classical ML/Deep Learning and scalable, enterprise-level Data Intelligence pipelines.

## 🎯 The Goal
Mastering the Databricks ecosystem to build, deploy, and manage scalable AI solutions.

## 📂 Project Structure
I am saving my progress in daily folders containing notebooks (`.ipynb` or `.py`), documentation, and any exported assets.

* [Day 01](./Day01) - Introduction & Environment Setup
* [Day 02](./Day02) - Databricks Architecture & Workspace
* [Day 03](./Day03) - PySpark Transformations Deep Dive
* [Day 04](./Day04) - ...
*(Continuing until Day 14)*

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Cloud Platform:** Databricks
* **Data Handling:** PySpark, Delta Lake, SQL
* **ML & Ops:** MLflow, Unity Catalog
* **Core Skills:** Data Engineering Pipelines & Scalable Machine Learning

## ✍️ Daily Progress Log
| Day | Focus Area | Key Takeaway |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| 01 | Setup & Workspace | Initialized Databricks clusters and community edition. |
| 02 | Data Loading | Configured Kaggle credentials, loaded e-commerce data from CSV files using shell commands, and explored the dataset using Spark SQL. |
